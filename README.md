# Quell

A Gobstones implementation of the Quell game, by Fallen Tree Games.

The first implementation follows the REPL style (Read-Eval-Print-Loop), where the board is only used to show the game, and to store its state between loops (current version of Gobstones does not support a persistant state in an interactive program).
It can be found on the tag REPL-Version.
It has a first operative level, but the style shown inefficient.
For that reason, another style will be tested.
